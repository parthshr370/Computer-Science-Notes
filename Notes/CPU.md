# CPU 

1. First CPU was **intel 4004** a 4 bit *CPU* 
2. **Assembly** is a helpful syntax for reading and writing machine code that’s easier for humans to read and write than raw bits

3. RAM is your computer’s main memory bank, a **large multi-purpose space** which stores all the data used by programs running on your computer. That includes the program code itself as well as **the code at the core of the operating system**. The *CPU always reads machine code directly from RAM*, and code can’t be run if it isn’t loaded into RAM.
4. CPU has a **instruction pointer** in it which points to a location in the **RAM** to fetch the next instruction . After the instruction is executed the CPU pointer moves the pointer and repeats the cycle

After the completion of the task the pointer moves immediately to the new instruction in the RAM
5. This instruction pointer is stored in a **register** .Registers are small storage buckets that are extremely fast for the CPU to read and write to
6. At the end of this process there’s machine code in a file somewhere. The operating system loads the file into RAM and instructs the CPU to jump the instruction pointer to that position in RAM. The CPU *continues running its fetch-execute cycle as usual*, so the program begins executing.
7. When you boot up your computer the instruction pointer starts at a programs somewhere that program is the **kernel** . Kernel has the full access to the computer memory, peripheral and other resources. 
8. **Windows kernel** is called ***NT Kernel***
9. Modern architecture have 2 modes to access the kernel , **Kernel mode** and the **User mode** . 
10. In kernel mode any instruction in the supported instruction is allowed . In user mode only a subset of instructions are allowed. Generally kernels and drivers run in kernel mode while application runs in user mode,

11. Current privilege level (CPL) contains two least significant bits of the cs register. Two bits can store four possible rings . Rings 1 and 2 are designed to run drivers.
12. Syscall or sytem call is **a way for programs to interact with the operating system**. A computer program makes a system call when it makes a request to the operating system's kernel.
13. It provides a layer of security for user to not misuse the kernel 
14. If you’ve ever written code that interacts with the OS, you’ll probably recognize functions like `open`, `read`, `fork`, and `exit`. Below a couple of layers of abstraction, these functions all use _system calls_ to ask the OS for help.
15. Programs need to pass data to the operating system when triggering a syscall; the OS needs to know which specific system call to execute alongside any data the syscall itself needs.
16. This is where **API**(Application programming interface) comes in . SInce it is widely immpractical for user to use the syscall for every program so we use the api .
