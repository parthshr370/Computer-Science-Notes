# Computer Science Notes 




`My personal notes` on various computer science topics, gathered over 1 year of learning.

I am still learning about a lot of things and will be **uploading notes** for everything I learn during my **journey**.

The notes will follow a **hierarchical order** for anyone who wants to get into **Computer Science** 

The topmost topics like **Linux , Networking , Git** (I beleive) will act like a side quest in your main Game(Journey) to get you ready for the real ComputerScience stuff.
